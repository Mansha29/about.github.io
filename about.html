        English subject is often split into two main topics which, obviously, can help a student to improve his/her skills in English. These two topics are English Literature and English Language. When we talk about English Literature it is simply the study of
        different books and writings from authors past and present. One of the important of studying this English Literature is that it allows every student to develop their ideas and ethical standpoints. However, when we say English Language it is the
        study of the language itself. It is the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of use of words in a structure and conventional way. The importance of this one is that it helps students to read and write well, how to
        use the English Language to its greatest effect and being creative with the language itself. When we combine these two main topics, we acquired that studying both topics can increase oneâ€™s vocabulary, increase creative ability and teach about
        the history of the language and the culture from which great writers were writing their books. English is a Lingua Franca which simply means that it is the most universal language. It is a language systematically used to make communication possible
        between people not sharing mother tongue. English as a Lingua Franca is a use of English language as a common means of communication for speakers of different first languages. ELF is also defined as inter-cultural communication. Today, the English
        language is very useful in our community and society because we use it in our daily lives. It helps us in communicating with others especially to those people from the other country. Learning English may also give us better insight into our native
        language and other languages we know. In studying our English language we use different types of communicating; verbal communication, non-verbal communication, written communication and many different forms. In addition to this, communication
        plays an important role in the process of conveying more knowledge and ideas as well. Communication is a way of interacting with people to transmit a message the speaker wants to convey to the receiver. In order to communicate properly we must
        construct the correct pronunciation because pronunciation affects how we understand the meaning of the words. The delivery of a word can be different to what the real meaning it has which can be a form of improper communication and with that it
        may lead to a lot of misinterpretations. To avoid this kind of mistake we need to teach accurate pronunciation. In culture, society and literature the English language has also its relation to this one. It is based on the English-speaking world
        and covers key topics connected to social issues, literature and other cultural expressions. Working with other cultural expressions is important for developing linguistic skills and understanding how others live, and their cultures and views
        on life. In using the internet, as what we have observed, majority of websites are written and created in English. It is the primary language of the press: more newspapers and books are written in English than in any other languages. It is just
        normal and dominant that you will be able to find more information regarding every subject if you can speak in this language. In travel and business, if you have a good understanding in English, it will be easy for you as a travel around the globe
        because it is the international language for foreigners, it is much way easier to get assistance and help. In business, English skills will also help you in this part. If you visit in some offices, companies and governmental organizations you
        will see the importance of English. In big company they usually hire a professional and educated employee who has a good speaking language in English.
